      "7": "Valgus instability of the elbow joint is a clinical diagnosis. However, many authors describe valgus stress radiographs as an aid in making this diagnosis. We studied valgus stress radiographs of 20 men (40 elbows) and 20 women (40 elbows), none with a history of elbow trauma or instability. The medial ulnohumeral distance was measured with no stress, valgus stress by gravity, and an applied valgus stress of 25 N (approximately 5 pounds). Measurements were made with the elbow positioned in extension and in 30 degrees of flexion. The increase in medial ulnohumeral gapping with either gravity or 5 pounds of stress was statistically significant at both extension and 30 degrees of flexion compared with the unstressed condition. The difference in ulnohumeral gapping between gravity stress and 5 pounds of valgus stress in extension and in 30 degrees of flexion was also significant. We found no differences with regard to hand dominance or sex. We conclude that uninjured elbows have significant medial ulnohumeral gapping on valgus stress radiography. Although this is an important tool in diagnosing valgus instability of the elbow, it may yield a false-positive assessment of valgus instability. Valgus stress radiographs comparing contralateral elbows may reduce the false-positive rate since there appears to be no significant difference in medial ulnohumeral gapping between the two elbows.",
      "4": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the usefulness of radiography for interpretation of musculoskeletal (MSK) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. DESIGNS AND PATIENTS: In a 1-year period, 1,030 MSK MRI studies were performed in 1,002 patients in our institution. For each study, the interpreting radiologist completed a questionnaire regarding the availability and utility of radiographs, radiological reports and clinical information for the interpretation of the MRI study. RESULTS: Radiographs were essential, very important or added information in 61-75% of all MSK MRI cases. Radiographs were judged as essential for reading of MRI studies more often for trauma, infection/inflammation and tumors than for degenerative and miscellaneous/normal diagnoses (chi(2)=60.95, df=16, P<0.0001). The clinical information was rated as \"essential\" or \"useful\" significantly more often than not (chi(2)=93.07, df=16, P<0.0001). The clinical and MRI diagnoses were the same or partially concordant significantly more often for tumors than for trauma, infection/inflammation and degenerative conditions, while in the miscellaneous/normal group they were different in 64% of cases. When the diagnoses were different, there were more instances in which radiographs were not available. CONCLUSIONS: Radiographs are an important, and sometimes essential, initial complementary study for reading of MSK MRI examinations. It is highly recommended that radiographs are available when MSK MRI studies are interpreted.",
      "6": "BACKGROUND: Stress radiography measures medial joint space opening of the elbow, but its value in the management of throwing athletes is unclear. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between medial joint opening (gapping and excess opening) and ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injury severity on magnetic resonance imaging, as well as to explore factors related to the unexpected finding of a greater opening of the uninjured elbow compared with the injured elbow (negative excess opening) with valgus stress radiography. METHODS: Medial joint space measurements were independently performed by 2 raters in a clinical series of 74 patients evaluated with standardized valgus stress radiography as part of their clinical workup for throwing-related medial elbow pain. Demographic data were collected by chart review, and UCL injury severity was classified based on available imaging into intact UCLs, partial-thickness tears of the anterior bundle, or full-thickness tears of the anterior bundle. RESULTS: Joint gapping was related to UCL injury severity (P = .003), and group-level comparison showed a difference among tear severity groups (P = .050). Excess opening was not significantly related to UCL injury severity (P = .109). A negative excess opening was observed in 22% of patients, but no factors corroborating guarding or a mechanical explanation were significant for a decreased medial joint opening of the injured elbow compared with the uninjured elbow. CONCLUSIONS: Medial joint gapping was correlated to UCL injury severity in throwing athletes with medial elbow pain and a clinical suggestion of UCL injury, but no association between injury severity and excess opening was observed in this clinical series, which may limit the usefulness of stress radiography in the clinical workup of throwing athletes."

      "16": "BACKGROUND: A 2-stage ovarian cancer screening strategy was evaluated that incorporates change of carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) levels over time and age to estimate risk of ovarian cancer. Women with high-risk scores were referred for transvaginal ultrasound (TVS). METHODS: A single-arm, prospective study of postmenopausal women was conducted. Participants underwent an annual CA125 blood test. Based on the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) result, women were triaged to next annual CA125 test (low risk), repeat CA125 test in 3 months (intermediate risk), or TVS and referral to a gynecologic oncologist (high risk). RESULTS: A total of 4051 women participated over 11 years. The average annual rate of referral to a CA125 test in 3 months was 5.8%, and the average annual referral rate to TVS and review by a gynecologic oncologist was 0.9%. Ten women underwent surgery on the basis of TVS, with 4 invasive ovarian cancers (1 with stage IA disease, 2 with stage IC disease, and 1 with stage IIB disease), 2 ovarian tumors of low malignant potential (both stage IA), 1 endometrial cancer (stage I), and 3 benign ovarian tumors, providing a positive predictive value of 40% (95% confidence interval\u2009=\u200912.2%, 73.8%) for detecting invasive ovarian cancer. The specificity was 99.9% (95% confidence interval\u2009=\u200999.7%, 100%). All 4 women with invasive ovarian cancer were enrolled in the study for at least 3 years with low-risk annual CA125 test values prior to rising CA125 levels. CONCLUSIONS: ROCA followed by TVS demonstrated excellent specificity and positive predictive value in a population of US women at average risk for ovarian cancer.",
      "14": "BACKGROUND: The value of screening for ovarian cancer is uncertain. We did a pilot randomised trial to assess multimodal screening with sequential CA 125 antigen and ultrasonography. METHODS: Postmenopausal women aged 45 years or older were randomised to a control group (n=10,977) or screened group (n=10,958). Women randomised to screening were offered three annual screens that involved measurement of serum CA 125, pelvic ultrasonography if CA 125 was 30 U/mL or more, and referral for gynaecological opinion if ovarian volume was 8.8 mL or more on ultrasonography. All women were followed up to see whether they developed invasive epithelial cancers of the ovary or fallopian tube (index cancers). FINDINGS: Of 468 women in the screened group with a raised CA 125, 29 were referred for a gynaecological opinion; screening detected an index cancer in six and 23 had false-positive screening results. The positive predictive value was 20.7%. During 7-year follow-up, ten further women with index cancers were identified in the screened group and 20 in the control group. Median survival of women with index cancers in the screened group was 72.9 months and in the control group was 41.8 months (p=0.0112). The number of deaths from an index cancer did not differ significantly between the control and screened groups (18 of 10,977 vs nine of 10,958, relative risk 2.0 [95% CI 0.78-5.13]). INTERPRETATION: These results show that a multimodal approach to ovarian cancer screening in a randomised trial is feasible and justify a larger randomised trial to see whether screening affects mortality.",
      "15": "Ovarian cancer is common in women from developed countries. We designed a prospective randomized controlled trial of ovarian cancer screening to establish an improved strategy for the early detection of cancers. Asymptomatic postmenopausal women were randomly assigned between 1985 and 1999 to either an intervention group (n = 41,688) or a control group (n = 40,799) in a ratio of 1:1, with follow-up of mean 9.2 years, in Shizuoka district, Japan. The original intention was to offer women in the intervention group annual screens by gynecological examination (sequential pelvic ultrasound [US] and serum CA125 test). Women with abnormal US findings and/or raised CA125 values were referred for surgical investigation by a gynecological oncologist. In December 2002, the code was broken and the Shizuoka Cohort Study of Ovarian Cancer Screening and Shizuoka Cancer Registry were searched to determine both malignant and nonmalignant diagnoses. Twenty-seven cancers were detected in the 41,688-screened women. Eight more cancers were diagnosed outside the screening program. Detection rates of ovarian cancer were 0.31 per 1000 at the prevalent screen and 0.38-0.74 per 1000 at subsequent screens; they increased with successive screening rounds. Among the 40,779 control women, 32 women developed ovarian cancer. The proportion of stage I ovarian cancer was higher in the screened group (63%) than in the control group (38%), which did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.2285). This is to our knowledge the first prospective randomized report of the ovarian cancer screening. The rise in the detection of early-stage ovarian cancer in asymptomatic postmenopausal women is not significant, but future decisions on screening policy should be informed by further follow-up from this trial.",
      "17": "BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer has a high case-fatality ratio, with most women not diagnosed until the disease is in its advanced stages. The United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) is a randomised controlled trial designed to assess the effect of screening on mortality. This report summarises the outcome of the prevalence (initial) screen in UKCTOCS. METHODS: Between 2001 and 2005, a total of 202 638 post-menopausal women aged 50-74 years were randomly assigned to no treatment (control; n=101 359); annual CA125 screening (interpreted using a risk of ovarian cancer algorithm) with transvaginal ultrasound scan as a second-line test (multimodal screening [MMS]; n=50 640); or annual screening with transvaginal ultrasound (USS; n=50 639) alone in a 2:1:1 ratio using a computer-generated random number algorithm. All women provided a blood sample at recruitment. Women randomised to the MMS group had their blood tested for CA125 and those randomised to the USS group were sent an appointment to attend for a transvaginal scan. Women with abnormal screens had repeat tests. Women with persistent abnormality on repeat screens underwent clinical evaluation and, where appropriate, surgery. This trial is registered as ISRCTN22488978 and with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00058032. FINDINGS: In the prevalence screen, 50 078 (98.9%) women underwent MMS, and 48 230 (95.2%) underwent USS. The main reasons for withdrawal were death (two MMS, 28 USS), non-ovarian cancer or other disease (none MMS, 66 USS), removal of ovaries (five MMS, 29 USS), relocation (none MMS, 39 USS), failure to attend three appointments for the screen (72 MMS, 757 USS), and participant changing their mind (483 MMS, 1490 USS). Overall, 4355 of 50 078 (8.7%) women in the MMS group and 5779 of 48 230 (12.0%) women in the USS group required a repeat test, and 167 (0.3%) women in the MMS group and 1894 (3.9%) women in the USS group required clinical evaluation. 97 of 50 078 (0.2%) women from the MMS group and 845 of 48 230 (1.8%) from the USS group underwent surgery. 42 (MMS) and 45 (USS) primary ovarian and tubal cancers were detected, including 28 borderline tumours (eight MMS, 20 USS). 28 (16 MMS, 12 USS) of 58 (48.3%; 95% CI 35.0-61.8) of the invasive cancers were stage I/II, with no difference (p=0.396) in stage distribution between the groups. A further 13 (five MMS, eight USS) women developed primary ovarian cancer during the year after the screen. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive-predictive values for all primary ovarian and tubal cancers were 89.4%, 99.8%, and 43.3% for MMS, and 84.9%, 98.2%, and 5.3% for USS, respectively. For primary invasive epithelial ovarian and tubal cancers, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive-predictive values were 89.5%, 99.8%, and 35.1% for MMS, and 75.0%, 98.2%, and 2.8% for USS, respectively. There was a significant difference in specificity (p<0.0001) but not sensitivity between the two screening groups for both primary ovarian and tubal cancers as well as primary epithelial invasive ovarian and tubal cancers. INTERPRETATION: The sensitivity of the MMS and USS screening strategies is encouraging. Specificity was higher in the MMS than in the USS group, resulting in lower rates of repeat testing and surgery. This in part reflects the high prevalence of benign adnexal abnormalities and the more frequent detection of borderline tumours in the USS group. The prevalence screen has established that the screening strategies are feasible. The results of ongoing screening are awaited so that the effect of screening on mortality can be determined.",
      "18": "PURPOSE: To evaluate prevalence screening in the first prospective trial of a new ovarian cancer screening (OCS) strategy (risk of ovarian cancer or ROC algorithm) on the basis of age and CA125 profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women, > or = 50 years were randomly assigned to a control group or screen group. Screening involved serum CA125, interpreted using the ROC algorithm. Participants with normal results returned to annual screening; those with intermediate results had repeat CA125 testing; and those with elevated values underwent transvaginal ultrasound (TVS). Women with abnormal or persistently equivocal TVS were referred for a gynecologic opinion. RESULTS: Thirteen thousand five hundred eighty-two women were recruited. Of 6,682 women randomly assigned to screening, 6,532 women underwent the first screen. After the initial CA125, 5,213 women were classified as normal risk, 91 women elevated, and 1,228 women intermediate. On repeat CA125 testing of the latter, a further 53 women were classified as elevated risk. All 144 women with elevated risk had TVS. Sixteen women underwent surgery. Eleven women had benign pathology; one woman had ovarian recurrence of breast cancer; one woman had borderline; and three women had primary invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) for primary invasive EOC were 99.8% (95% CI, 99.7 to 99.9) and 19% (95% CI, 4.1 to 45.6), respectively. CONCLUSION: An OCS strategy using the ROC algorithm is feasible and can achieve high specificity and PPV in postmenopausal women. It is being used in the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening and in the United States in both the Cancer Genetics Network and the Gynecology Oncology Group trials of high-risk women.",
      "12": "CONTEXT: Screening for ovarian cancer with cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) and transvaginal ultrasound has an unknown effect on mortality. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of screening for ovarian cancer on mortality in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized controlled trial of 78,216 women aged 55 to 74 years assigned to undergo either annual screening (n = 39,105) or usual care (n = 39,111) at 10 screening centers across the United States between November 1993 and July 2001. Intervention The intervention group was offered annual screening with CA-125 for 6 years and transvaginal ultrasound for 4 years. Participants and their health care practitioners received the screening test results and managed evaluation of abnormal results. The usual care group was not offered annual screening with CA-125 for 6 years or transvaginal ultrasound but received their usual medical care. Participants were followed up for a maximum of 13 years (median [range], 12.4 years [10.9-13.0 years]) for cancer diagnoses and death until February 28, 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality from ovarian cancer, including primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers. Secondary outcomes included ovarian cancer incidence and complications associated with screening examinations and diagnostic procedures. RESULTS: Ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 212 women (5.7 per 10,000 person-years) in the intervention group and 176 (4.7 per 10,000 person-years) in the usual care group (rate ratio [RR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.48). There were 118 deaths caused by ovarian cancer (3.1 per 10,000 person-years) in the intervention group and 100 deaths (2.6 per 10,000 person-years) in the usual care group (mortality RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.82-1.71). Of 3285 women with false-positive results, 1080 underwent surgical follow-up; of whom, 163 women experienced at least 1 serious complication (15%). There were 2924 deaths due to other causes (excluding ovarian, colorectal, and lung cancer) (76.6 per 10,000 person-years) in the intervention group and 2914 deaths (76.2 per 10,000 person-years) in the usual care group (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.96-1.06). CONCLUSIONS: Among women in the general US population, simultaneous screening with CA-125 and transvaginal ultrasound compared with usual care did not reduce ovarian cancer mortality. Diagnostic evaluation following a false-positive screening test result was associated with complications. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00002540.",
      "13": "BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer has a poor prognosis, with just 40% of patients surviving 5 years. We designed this trial to establish the effect of early detection by screening on ovarian cancer mortality. METHODS: In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited postmenopausal women aged 50-74 years from 13 centres in National Health Service Trusts in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Exclusion criteria were previous bilateral oophorectomy or ovarian malignancy, increased risk of familial ovarian cancer, and active non-ovarian malignancy. The trial management system confirmed eligibility and randomly allocated participants in blocks of 32 using computer-generated random numbers to annual multimodal screening (MMS) with serum CA125 interpreted with use of the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm, annual transvaginal ultrasound screening (USS), or no screening, in a 1:1:2 ratio. The primary outcome was death due to ovarian cancer by Dec 31, 2014, comparing MMS and USS separately with no screening, ascertained by an outcomes committee masked to randomisation group. All analyses were by modified intention to screen, excluding the small number of women we discovered after randomisation to have a bilateral oophorectomy, have ovarian cancer, or had exited the registry before recruitment. Investigators and participants were aware of screening type. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00058032. FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2001, and Oct 21, 2005, we randomly allocated 202,638 women: 50,640 (25\u00b70%) to MMS, 50,639 (25\u00b70%) to USS, and 101,359 (50\u00b70%) to no screening. 202,546 (>99\u00b79%) women were eligible for analysis: 50,624 (>99\u00b79%) women in the MMS group, 50,623 (>99\u00b79%) in the USS group, and 101,299 (>99\u00b79%) in the no screening group. Screening ended on Dec 31, 2011, and included 345,570 MMS and 327,775 USS annual screening episodes. At a median follow-up of 11\u00b71 years (IQR 10\u00b70-12\u00b70), we diagnosed ovarian cancer in 1282 (0\u00b76%) women: 338 (0\u00b77%) in the MMS group, 314 (0\u00b76%) in the USS group, and 630 (0\u00b76%) in the no screening group. Of these women, 148 (0\u00b729%) women in the MMS group, 154 (0\u00b730%) in the USS group, and 347 (0\u00b734%) in the no screening group had died of ovarian cancer. The primary analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model gave a mortality reduction over years 0-14 of 15% (95% CI -3 to 30; p=0\u00b710) with MMS and 11% (-7 to 27; p=0\u00b721) with USS. The Royston-Parmar flexible parametric model showed that in the MMS group, this mortality effect was made up of 8% (-20 to 31) in years 0-7 and 23% (1-46) in years 7-14, and in the USS group, of 2% (-27 to 26) in years 0-7 and 21% (-2 to 42) in years 7-14. A prespecified analysis of death from ovarian cancer of MMS versus no screening with exclusion of prevalent cases showed significantly different death rates (p=0\u00b7021), with an overall average mortality reduction of 20% (-2 to 40) and a reduction of 8% (-27 to 43) in years 0-7 and 28% (-3 to 49) in years 7-14 in favour of MMS. INTERPRETATION: Although the mortality reduction was not significant in the primary analysis, we noted a significant mortality reduction with MMS when prevalent cases were excluded. We noted encouraging evidence of a mortality reduction in years 7-14, but further follow-up is needed before firm conclusions can be reached on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of ovarian cancer screening.

      "19": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of ultrasonographic screening on stage at detection and long-term disease-specific survival of women with epithelial ovarian cancer. METHODS: Eligibility included all asymptomatic women aged 50 years and older and women aged 25 years and older with a documented family history of ovarian cancer. From 1987 to 2011, 37,293 women received annual ultrasonographic screening. Women with abnormal screens underwent tumor morphology indexing, serum biomarker analysis, and surgery. RESULTS: Forty-seven invasive epithelial ovarian cancers and 15 epithelial ovarian tumors of low malignant potential were detected. No women with low malignant potential tumors experienced recurrent disease. Stage distribution for invasive epithelial cancers was: stage I, 22 (47%); stage II, 11 (23%); stage III, 14 (30%), and stage IV, 0 (0%). Follow-up varied from 2 months to 20.1 years (mean, 5.8 years). The 5-year survival rate for invasive epithelial ovarian cancers detected by screening was: stage I, 95%\u00b14.8%; stage II, 77.1%\u00b114.5%; and stage III, 76.2%\u00b112.1%. The 5-year survival rate for all women with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer detected by screening as well as interval cancers was 74.8%\u00b16.6% compared with 53.7%\u00b12.3% for unscreened women with ovarian cancer from the same institution treated by the same surgical and chemotherapeutic protocols (P<.001). CONCLUSION: Annual ultrasonographic screening of asymptomatic women achieved increased detection of early-stage ovarian cancer cases and an increase in 5-year disease-specific survival rate for women with ovarian cancer.
