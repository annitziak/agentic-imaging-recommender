### üìÅ ICD Coding data

This folder contains:
1. `ICD_Codes_and_Descriptions`: The strutured ICD-9-CM folder with all the available codes and their short and long descriptions. In total about ~13,000 codes. We used the long description column for making the FAISS index, for the codes in our dataset.
2. `ICD_Dataset_Sample`: A small sample of just 50 records used by the ICD Mapping Agent, each including the assigned ICD-9-CM code, its description (from `ICD_Codes_and_Descriptions`), the original and LLaMA 3.1 8B-standardized clinical notes. This is just for illustration.
3. `ACR_ICD_Mapping_Sample.xlsx`: A small sample for condition `Breast Pain` to show how the document is structured and the mapping being done by the `ACR_Criteria_Checker`
4. `index/icd_index.faiss`: FAISS index of the encoded icd code long descriptions.
5.  `index/icd_codes.json`: description and icd codes present in the dataset, for easier retrieval.
